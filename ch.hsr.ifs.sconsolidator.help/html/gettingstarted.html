<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<a name="gettingstarted"></a>
<p>This guide gives you an overview of the various functionalities SConsolidator provides.
We will show screenshots for the most important use cases and explain the screens
shortly.</p>

<h2>Add SCons support to an existing project</h2>
<a name="addsconssupport"></a>
<p>To add SCons support to an existing C/C++ project, just right click on the project(s) in the project explorer
and choose one of the following two sub-menus of "SCons":
<ul>
<li>"Use self-provided SCons build" (aka <i>existing</i> mode) for projects where you provide the SCons build files</li>
<li>"Use generated SCons build" (aka <i>managed</i> mode) for projects where SConsolidator should create and update the SCons build files</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that you should only use <i>managed</i> for simple C/C++ projects. It can be considered as a good starting
point if you are not yet familiar with SCons. As soon as your projects grow in size and complexity, you want to use
your own provided SCons build files.
</p>
<p>For non-C/C++ projects, you only have one sub-menu named "Add SCons support".
</p>

<h2>Building projects with SCons</h2>
<a name="buildproject"></a>
<p>If you request a build, the output of a SCons build run is shown in a project specific console. 
Compile errors are shown in red and hyperlinks are provided to directly jump to the location in the editor where the
error was found by the compiler. Error markers are created for the compiler errors as
we are used from Eclipse.</p>

<h2>Target View</h2>
<a name="targetview"></a>
<p>SCons target view shows all the SCons projects in the current workspace and allows
you to maintain the targets on a project level. To request a build for a specific target, you have to select it
in the view and click the build button in the upper right corner. The same can be achieved for
a build in the <a href="#interactiveconsole">interactive console</a>.</p>
<img alt="SCons target view allows to conveniently build a target." src="../images/targetview.png" />
<p>There is a dialog to create a new target for a SCons project. There you can define the
name of the target and additional SCons options which will be used
when SCons is invoked. Furthermore, you can also specify a target alias which is also shown
in the target view.</p>

<h2>Dependency View</h2>
<a name="dependencyview"></a>
<p>The dependency view visualizes the dependencies of the selected target
SCons has emitted. You can choose a target of a SCons project in the workspace
with a click on the lookup symbol in the upper right corner. The dependencies are
then shown in the graph area.</p>

<h2>C/C++ specific support</h2> 
<a name="cppsupport"></a>

<h3>Create new SCons based C/C++ Managed Project</h3>
<a name="cppmanaged"></a>
<p>To create a new SCons based project, you can use the "New Project" wizard of Eclipse
and choose "C/C++ project". There you can see three new project types for SCons
managed projects: executable, shared library and static library project.</p> 
<img alt="Wizard to create a new SCons managed project (executable, shared or static library)."

<p>SConsolidator also provides a facility to convert existing managed projects
to SCons projects with a context menu on the project level ("SCons -&gt; Add SCons support")
and with a wizard as shown in this figure.</p>

<h3>Import of Existing SCons based C/C++ Project</h3>
<a name="cppexisting"></a>
<p>SConsolidator helps you to import existing SCons based C/C++ projects with a wizard. You can choose 
the location where the code of the existing project is located. If the location contains 
an Eclipse project, the name of the project
is deduced and shown in the corresponding input field. In case you want to
set further options for the initial SCons run, you have the possibility to put them in the field "SCons options". SConsolidator will then try to gather all include paths
and macros of your project necessary for the CDT indexer to properly work and store them in the project settings.</p>

<h2>Interactive Console</h2>
<a name="interactiveconsole"></a>
<p>To build single targets without the need to invoke full builds with every change, we
provide an interactive console with SConsolidator where you have all the possibilities known from 
SCons interactive mode. We allow building and cleaning of the
corresponding target(s) for the source file currently loaded in the active editor and a
redo of the last action as can be seen from the buttons. Of course,
you can also type SCons commands in the interactive console directly.</p>
