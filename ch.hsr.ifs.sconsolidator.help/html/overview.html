<h1>SConsolidator - Eclipse plug-in for SCons</h1>

<p>SCons is an open source software build tool which tries to fix the numerous
weaknesses of make and its derivatives. For example, the missing automatic
dependency extraction, make's complex syntax to describe build properties and cross-
platform issues when using shell commands and scripts. SCons is a self-contained tool
which is independent of existing platform utilities. Because it is based on Python a SCons
user has the full power of a programming language to deal with all build related issues.</p>

<p>However, maintaining a SCons-based C/C++ project with Eclipse CDT meant, that all the
intelligence SCons puts into your project dependencies had to be re-entered into Eclipse
CDT's project settings, so that CDT's indexer and parser would be able to know your
code's compile settings and enable many of CDTs features. In addition, SCons' intelligence
comes at the price of relatively long build startup times, when SCons (re-) analyses the
project dependencies which can become annoying when you just fix a simple syntax error.</p>

<p>SConsolidator addresses these issues and provides tool integration for SCons in Eclipse
for a convenient development experience. The plug-in features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conversion of existing C/C++ managed build projects to SCons projects</li>
<li>Import of existing SCons projects into Eclipse with wizard support</li>
<li>Interactive mode to quickly build single C/C++ source files speeding up round trip times</li>
<li>A special view for a convenient build target management of all workspace projects</li>
<li>Graph visualization of build dependencies that helps in debugging SCons build problems</li>
</ul>
