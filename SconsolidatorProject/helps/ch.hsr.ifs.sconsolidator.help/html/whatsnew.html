<h1>What's new in SConsolidator</h1>
<p><b>Changelog</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>1.0.0</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with ignoring CXXFlags resulting in the CDT indexer not being able to parse C++11/14 code properly</li>
<li>Use colors of CDT console settings in SConsolidator build console</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>0.6.0</b>
<ul>
<li>The two supported modes <i>managed</i> (projects where SConsolidator creates and updates the SCons build files) vs. <i>existing</i> (projects 
where the user provides the SCons build files) are now clearly reflected in the UI; the SCons project menu now has two separate entries:
<ul>
<li>Use self-provided SCons build (<i>existing</i>)</li>
<li>Use generated SCons build (<i>managed</i>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is now possible to add SCons support to multiple projects in the Eclipse project explorer by selecting them and using the corresponding project context menu</li>
<li>Improved support for C projects</li>
<li>Possibility to specify the SCons executable name in the workspace settings non-absolute (SConsolidator determines the path by using the PATH environment variable)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>0.5.0</b>
<ul>
<li>Adding SCons to an existing CDT managed project now offers to choose between a managed SCons project (SConsolidator creates
and maintains the SConstruct file) and the possibility to use a self-provided SConstruct file
</li>
<li>Compatibility with Eclipse Juno
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>0.4.0</b>
<ul>
<li>Possibility to change environment variables for running SCons on a project level
</li>
<li>Various minor bug fixes
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>0.3.0</b>
<ul>
<li>No need for specifying "dry-run" option anymore for projects making use of SCons Autobuild (Configure) feature
</li>
<li>Various minor bug fixes
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>0.2.0</b>
<ul>
<li>Basic support for non-C/C++ projects (so far, only C/C++ projects were supported):
To add SCons support to an existing non-C/C++ project, just right click on the project in the project explorer
and choose "SCons-&gt;Add SCons Support". Afterwards, if you request a build, SCons is called. SConsolidator's target and 
dependency view also work together with non-C/C++ projects. However, interactive builds are currently not supported yet.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>0.1.0</b>
<ul>
<li>SConsolidator plug-ins are now signed</li>
<li>Various little bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>0.0.4</b>
<ul>
<li>Support for SCons v2.1.0: changes were necessary since v2.1.0 SCons uses tuples instead of plain old strings for its environment variable CPPDEFINES</li>
<li>Env variables can be specified with "${env_name}" in the build settings now to eliminate potential differences when working with SCons in a shell environment</li>
<li>Improved compatibility to Eclipse Helios release</li>
<li>Check for SCons installation path is now only done one when the plug-in is loaded instead of when building a project</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>0.0.3</b> - First public available release</li>
</ul>
